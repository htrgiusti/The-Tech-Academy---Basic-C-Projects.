# DateTime Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy bootcamp. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Prints the current date and time to the console.**

**2. Asks the user for a number.‚Äù**

**3. Prints to the console the exact time it will be in X hours, X being the number the user entered in step 2.**

**4. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
