# Lambda Expression Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Create an Employee class with the following properties:**

a. Id

b. First Name

c. Last Name


**2. In the Main() method, create a list of at least 10 employees. At least two employees should have the first name “Joe”.**

**3. Using a foreach loop, create a new list of all employees with the first name “Joe”. In your comparison statement, remember to reference the property of the object you are checking.**

**4. Perform the same action again, but this time with a lambda expression.**

**5. Using a lambda expression, make a list of all employees with an Id number greater than 5.**

**6. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
