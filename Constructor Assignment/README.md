# Constructor Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy bootcamp. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Create a const variable.**

**2. Create a variable using the keyword “var.”**

**3. Chain two constructors together.**

**4. Implement the SayName() method inside of the Employee class.**

**5. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
