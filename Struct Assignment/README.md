# Struct Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Create a struct called Number and give it the property “Amount” and have it be of data type decimal.**

**2. In the Main() method, create an object of data type Number and assign an amount to it.**

**3. Print this amount to the console.**

**4. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
