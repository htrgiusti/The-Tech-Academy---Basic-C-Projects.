# Branching Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy bootcamp. 
In this assignment I had to create a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package.

**Requirements**

1. **The first line of the program must be: “Welcome to Package Express. Please follow the instructions below.”**

2. **The user must then be prompted for the package weight.**

3. **If the weight is greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too heavy to be shipped via Package Express. Have a good day.” At this point the program would end.**

4. **The user must then be prompted for the package width.**

5. **Then the package height.**

6. **Then the package length.**

7. **If the dimensions total greater than 50, display the error message, “Package too big to be shipped via Package Express.” At this point the program would end.**

8. **Next, multiply the three dimensions (height, width, & length) together, and multiply the product by the weight. Finally, divide the outcome by 100.**

9. **The result of that calculation is the quote.**

10. **Display the quote to the user as a dollar amount.**

12. **Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
