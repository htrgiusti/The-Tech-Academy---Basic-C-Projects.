# Console App Array Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy bootcamp. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Create a one-dimensional Array of strings. Ask the user to select an index of the Array and then display the string at that index on the screen.**

**2. Create a one-dimensional Array of integers. Ask the user to select an index of the Array and then display the integer at that index on the screen.**

**3. Add in a message that displays when the user selects an index that doesnâ€™t exist.**

**4. Create a list of strings. Ask the user to select an index of the list and then display the content at that index on the screen.**

**5. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
