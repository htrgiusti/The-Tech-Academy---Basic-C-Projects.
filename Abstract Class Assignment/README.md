# Abstract Class Assignment
This is a C# Assignment from The Tech Academy bootcamp. 
In this assignment I had to perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:

**1. Create an abstract class called Person with two properties: string firstName and string lastName.**

**2. Give it the method SayName().**

**3. Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class.**

**4. Implement the SayName() method inside of the Employee class.**

**5. Inside the Main() method, instantiate an Employee object with firstName “Sample” and lastName “Student”. Call the SayName() method on the object.**

**6. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.**
